{-
    You can call C functions by using 'ccall'.
    But String in Bodhi is different from String in C language.
    So convert value by using string_to_cstr.

    Be careful to use 'ccall', because 'ccall' is out of typing.

	let _ = ccall fwrite (cstr text) 1 (string_length text) fp in
	let _ = ccall fclose fp in
